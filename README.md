## `UniversalReadabilityIndex`

**Description:**

Drawing on a series of papers by [Matricciani](https://www.mdpi.com/2813-2203/2/2/16), the Universal Readability Index (URI, or G<sub>U</sub> in the papers) is proposed as a refinement over traditional readability metrics. Unlike conventional indices, URI incorporates the cognitive constraints of working memory into its model, aiming to provide a more accurate estimation of a textâ€™s readability.
A provisional mapping of the URI value to a full-scale IQ (FSIQ) score is proposed.
